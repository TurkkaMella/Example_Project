\section{RGB image example}

In this section, we include an external graphic into our document. This can be an image file such as a JPEG, PNG, or PDF. The figure below demonstrates how an image is included using LaTeX.

\begin{figure}[htbp]
\centering
\includegraphics[width=0.8\textwidth]{66.png} % Updated to the correct image file name

\caption{The included image.} % Caption for the image
\label{fig:external-graphic} % Label used for referencing the figure in-text
\end{figure}

As shown in Figure~\ref{fig:external-graphic}, you can reference figures easily in your text.
