\section{A New Chapter on Equations}

This chapter introduces some fundamental equations in physics.

The first equation is Newton's second law, which states that the force applied to an object is equal to the mass of the object multiplied by its acceleration.

\begin{equation}
F = ma
\label{eq:NewtonII} % This makes it possible to reference to this equation
\end{equation}

This law is a cornerstone in classical mechanics.

Next, we consider the equation for gravitational force, which describes the attraction between two masses.

\begin{mdframed}    % This is now boxed equation
\begin{equation}
F = G \frac{m_1 m_2}{r^2}
\label{eq:gravity} % This makes it possible to reference this equation
\end{equation}
\end{mdframed}

Where $G$ is the gravitational constant, $m_1$ and $m_2$ are the masses of the two objects, and $r$ is the distance between their centers.

Lastly, we look at the equation for kinetic energy, which represents the energy that an object possesses due to its motion.

\begin{equation}
KE = \frac{1}{2} mv^2
\label{eq:kineticEnergy} % This makes it possible to reference to this equation
\end{equation}

Where $m$ is the mass of the object and $v$ is its velocity.

Inserting a new equation between these will automatically update the numbering without any additional adjustments needed.
