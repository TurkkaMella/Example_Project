\section{Referencing Examples}

One of the fundamental aspects of LaTeX is its ability to handle references dynamically. This feature is particularly useful when dealing with mathematical equations, figures, tables, and even sections of text, such as appendices. A prime example of this is Equation~\ref{eq:gravity}, which introduces the concept of gravitational force. Similarly, we can reference sections of our document, such as the appendix on Nikola Tesla, which can be found in Appendix~\ref{app:Tesla}. The ability to reference dynamically ensures that our text always points to the correct equation or section, regardless of any modifications that might occur in the document structure.
